# RPubs Materials

In this repo, I have all the R markdown files associated with my RPubs account.

You can check out my RPubs [here](https://rpubs.com/jsloane).

For each of the published documents, you will find an .Rmd file and a .html file. 
- Open the .Rmd file if you wish to view all of the r code
- Open the .html to view the final published document

Most of the examples use the penguins dataset from the `palmerpenguins` package, but there are a couple of other datasets I've included in the repo, as well. 

*Please note: a lot of these documents are notes from a psychology course I taught at UNSW. For example, "wk3_rstudio_basics.Rmd" is from week 3 of the course and we focused on the basics of RStudio.*
