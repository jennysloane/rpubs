# RPubs Materials

In this repo, I have all the R markdown files associated with my RPubs account.

You can check out my RPubs [here](https://rpubs.com/jsloane).

For each of the published documents, you will find an .Rmd file and a .html file. 
- Open the .Rmd file if you wish to view all of the r code
- Open the .html to view the final published document
